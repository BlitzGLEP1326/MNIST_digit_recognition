<h1>Digit Recognizer for MNIST Data Set</h1>
In this project, I try different classification methods to recognize the digits in the MNIST data set.

<h2>Classification Methods</h2>
<ul>
<li>
KNN: accuracy 96.64%, running time &#8776 2 hours
</li>
<li>
Linear kernel SVM: accuracy 93.98%, training time &#8776 10min, testing_time &#8776 3min
</li>
<li>
Polynomial kernel SVM with degree 2: accuracy 91.35%, training time &#8776 20min, testing_time &#8776 8min
</li>
<li>
Radial basis kernel SVM with default C and gamma: accuracy 94.46%, training time + testing time &#8776 20min
</li>
</ul>
