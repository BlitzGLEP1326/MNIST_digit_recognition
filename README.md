<h1>Digit Recognizer for MNIST Data Set</h1>
In this project, I try different classification methods to recognize the digits in the MNIST data set.

<h2>Classification Methods</h2>
<ul>
<li>
KNN: accuracy 96.64%, running time: ~2 hours
</li>
<li>
Linear kenrel SVM: accuracy 93.98%, training time &lt 10min, testing_time &#60 3min
</li>
</ul>
